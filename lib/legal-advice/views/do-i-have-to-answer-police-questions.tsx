        <section className="space-y-4">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Your Right to Silence Under PACE</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) establishes your fundamental right 
            to remain silent when questioned by the police. This right is a cornerstone of the 
            criminal justice system in England and Wales, protecting individuals from being 
            compelled to incriminate themselves.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            When you are arrested or invited to attend a voluntary interview under caution, the 
            police must inform you of your rights by reading the standard caution:
          </p>
          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 my-4">
            "You do not have to say anything. But, it may harm your defence if you do not mention 
            when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may 
            be given in evidence."
          </blockquote>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            This caution, required under PACE Code C paragraph 10.5, clearly states that you are 
            not obligated to speak, but it also warns that silence may have consequences if you 
            later present information in court that you did not disclose during the interview.
          </p>

        {/* Section 2: When You Must Provide Information */}
        <section className="space-y-4">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Situations Where Information May Be Required</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            While you generally have the right to remain silent, there are specific circumstances 
            where you may be legally required to provide certain personal details:
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Stop and Account</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If a police officer stops you in a public place to ask about your movements or 
            behaviour (known as a 'stop and account'), you are not legally required to answer 
            their questions. You may ask if you are being detained. If you are not under arrest 
            and not being detained, you are free to leave.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Stop and Search</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            During a stop and search under PACE or other legislation, you are not legally 
            obligated to answer questions. However, the police officer should explain why you 
            are being searched and what they are looking for. You may be asked for your name and 
            address, but there is generally no legal requirement to provide this information 
            during a standard stop and search.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Section 50 of the Police Reform Act 2002</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If a police officer or Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) reasonably believes 
            that you have engaged in anti-social behaviour, they can require you to provide your 
            name and address under Section 50 of the Police Reform Act 2002. Refusing to provide 
            this information when required, or providing false details, is a criminal offence 
            that can result in arrest.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Road Traffic Matters</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If you are driving a motor vehicle and are stopped by the police, you are required 
            to provide your name, address, and details of the vehicle's owner. This requirement 
            stems from the Road Traffic Act 1988. Failure to provide this information when 
            required can result in prosecution.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Police Station Detention</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If you are detained at a police station, the custody officer will ask for your 
            personal details including your name, address, date of birth, and nationality. While 
            you may be asked to provide this information, your right to silence regarding the 
            offence under investigation remains intact.

        <section className="space-y-4">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">What Happens During a Police Interview</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If you are arrested or attend a police station voluntarily for interview, the 
            following typically occurs:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 ml-4">
            <li>The custody officer or investigating officer will explain why you are there</li>
            <li>You will be read the police caution (as outlined above)</li>
            <li>You will be informed of your right to free, independent legal advice</li>
            <li>The interview will usually be audio or video recorded</li>
            <li>Everything you say during the interview can be used as evidence in court</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Choosing to exercise your right to silence during a police interview is a significant 
            decision. While it is your legal right, the court may draw adverse inferences from 
            your silence in certain circumstances, particularly if you later present a defence in 
            court that you could have raised during the interview.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allows courts to draw inferences from 
            silence in specific situations, such as when a suspect fails to mention facts that 
            they later rely on in their defence, or fails to account for objects, substances, or 
            marks found on their person or in their possession.

        <section className="space-y-4">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">The Importance of Legal Advice</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Before deciding whether to answer police questions or exercise your right to silence, 
            it is highly advisable to speak with a solicitor. This is particularly important because:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 ml-4">
            <li>You have the right to free, independent legal advice at the police station, funded by legal aid</li>
            <li>A solicitor can help you understand the implications of answering or remaining silent</li>
            <li>They can advise you on your specific situation and the best approach to take</li>
            <li>They can ensure your rights are protected throughout the process</li>
            <li>They can be present during your interview to provide support and intervention if necessary</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            A solicitor can help you formulate a response strategy that protects your interests 
            while navigating the complex legal landscape of police interviews. They understand 
            when silence may be appropriate and when providing certain information may be in your 
            best interests.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Importantly, you cannot be penalised for requesting legal advice, and the police must 
            not proceed with an interview until you have had a reasonable opportunity to consult 
            with a solicitor if you wish to do so.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Common Misunderstandings</h2>
          
          <div className="space-y-6">
            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">"If I remain silent, I must be guilty"</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                This is not true. The right to silence is a fundamental legal protection available 
                to everyone, regardless of guilt or innocence. Exercising this right does not 
                indicate guilt, and the court cannot infer guilt solely from your decision to 
                remain silent. However, as noted above, the court may draw inferences in specific 
                circumstances outlined in legislation.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">"I must answer all police questions"</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Incorrect. Beyond providing basic personal details in specific situations (such as 
                under Section 50 of the Police Reform Act 2002 or during road traffic stops), you 
                are not legally required to answer questions about an alleged offence. Your right 
                to remain silent is protected by law.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">"Remaining silent cannot be used against me"</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                While you have the right to remain silent, the Criminal Justice and Public Order 
                Act 1994 allows courts to draw adverse inferences in certain circumstances. If you 
                fail to mention during questioning a fact that you later rely on in your defence, 
                the court may conclude that you invented this fact later. This is why legal advice 
                before an interview is so important.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                This is a common misconception. Everyone has the right to free, independent legal 
                advice at the police station, regardless of their financial circumstances. This is 
                funded through legal aid. Ask the custody officer to arrange the duty solicitor or your
                own solicitor.
